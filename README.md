# chrisweb utilities.js

Javascript utilities belt for very specific tasks.

main goal(s):
* console log wrapper for colored log messages
* utilities belt: javascript collection of useful functions that are useful for specific situations, so a lot more specific than underscore
* should work in the browser as well in nodejs

## usage

@TODO

## build

install the latest nodejs (if you haven't already) [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)  
update npm to latest version

`npm install npm@latest -g`

install the dependencies

`npm install`

to lint the typescript files

`npm run lint`

run the tests  

`npm run test`

to build the distributions (es6 module (esm.js) and the UMD version)

`npm run build`

or by using yarn  

`yarn build`

## development

in devlopment you can use watch to rebuild every time you edit a typescript file

`npm run watch`

## contributing

Bug reports, tests, fixes, new features and all kind of comments / feedback are welcome ðŸ˜ƒ [Submit a feature request or bug issue](https://github.com/chrisweb/chrisweb-utilities.js/issues/new/choose)

## testing setup notes

I used the [jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/)

I added the jest typescript types and the [ts-jest package](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)  

installed dependencies:  

`npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest`

command to create a basic jest.config.js file:  

`npx ts-jest config:init	yarn ts-jest config:init`

If you use VSCode, consider using the [vscode jest extension](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest)

Besides reading the official documentation, you can check out this quick [introduction to jest](https://flaviocopes.com/jest/)  blog post

## linting setup notes

	> we plan to deprecate TSLint and focus our efforts instead on improving ESLintâ€™s TypeScript support  
    
Their [blog post](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) announcing that [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) will be deprecated in 2019 and you should switch to [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) when TSLint is officially deprecated  

TSlint will be deprecated [github ticket](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534)
