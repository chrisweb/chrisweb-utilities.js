# chrisweb utilities.js

Javascript utilities belt for very specific tasks.

main goal(s):

* console log wrapper for colored log messages
* utilities belt: javascript collection of useful functions that are useful for specific situations, so a lot more specific than underscore
* should work in the browser as well in nodejs

## usage

@TODO

## build

install the latest nodejs (if you haven't already) [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)  

install or update to the latest git version [git scm downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (During installation at the step "choosing the default editor used by Git", if like me you are using visual studio code you might want to chose the new option "use visual studio code as Git's default editor") (also if like me you are on windows, at the step "adjusting your PATH environment", ensure the second radio button option is selected "git from the line and also from 3rd-party software" to ensure git is added to the windows PATH, which will allow you to use git with any command line tool like windows powershell for example)  

git clone this repository if you haven't already

open your favorite command line tool and go to the root directory of this repository

update npm to latest version  

`npm install npm@latest -g`

install the dependencies

`npm i`

to lint the typescript files

`npm run lint`

run the tests  

`npm run test`

to build the distributions (es6 module (esm.js) and the UMD version)

`npm run build`

## development

in devlopment you can use watch to rebuild every time you edit a typescript file

`npm run watch`

you can also use watch for the test suite  

`npm run watch:test`

## contributing

Bug reports, tests, fixes, new features and all kind of comments / feedback are welcome ðŸ˜ƒ [Submit a feature request or bug issue](https://github.com/chrisweb/chrisweb-utilities.js/issues/new/choose)

## testing setup notes

I used the [jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/)

I added the jest typescript types and the [ts-jest package](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)  

installed dependencies:  

`npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest`

command to create a basic jest.config.js file:  

`npx ts-jest config:init yarn ts-jest config:init`

If you use VSCode, consider using the [vscode jest extension](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest)

Besides reading the official documentation, you can check out this quick [introduction to jest](https://flaviocopes.com/jest/)  blog post
